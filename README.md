# jl-pkgman: A Package Manager for Matlab

It’s kind of a pain to install and manage third-party Matlab packages. jl-pkgman
is here to make that easier. It is a package manager for Matlab libraries and code.
It’s inspired by pip, Mac Homebrew, Maven, and Octave’s `pkg` tool.

> WARNING: jl-pkgman is currently under early development. It is ALPHA quality
> software, and not ready for production use. Use at your own
> risk!

libraries.
